I created this script because I needed a way to automatically send users a policy agreement document after they submitted a Google Form.

The Google Form is configured to insert data into a Google Spreadsheet.

You'll insert the script by going to Tools > Script Editor, pasting in the code and then customizing it for your particular situation.

Once inside the script editor, you'll go to Edit > Current Project Triggers, Add a Trigger, and set the script to execute on Form Submit.
